# voice-messenger

In preparation for a presentation on WebRTC, I decided that I would write a simple application that uses MediaStream in the form of 
voice recording.

The purpose of the application is to chat in the form of voice messages.

A demo of the application is available [here](https://voicemessenger.netlify.app/).
